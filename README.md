You need to have an adequate firefox installation compatible with
whatever geckodriver you decide to use. The one included here is
version 0.27.0

This is very much stuck together with glue. It sucks and it will break.
I will work on it in the future to improve it probably maybe.

## Compatibility

Should work on both Linux and Windows, I don't own a mac so...

Developed with:

* Ubuntu

* Firefox version: 80.0.1 (64-bit) 

* Geckodriver 0.27.0


If it doesn't work, try installing these versions of Firefox and Gecko.
