You need to have an adequate firefox installation compatible with
whatever geckodriver you decide to use. The one included here is
version 0.27.0

## Compatibility

Should work on both Linux and Windows, I don't own a mac so...

Developed with:

* Ubuntu

* Firefox version: 80.0.1 (64-bit) 

* Geckodriver 0.27.0


If it doesn't work, try installing these versions of Firefox and Gecko.
